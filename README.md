# The Vibe Check
## Application Description
Our application aims to help users discover locations that align with their current mood, making it easier to decide where to eat, relax, or hang out with friends. Traditional map apps like Google Maps or Apple Maps often rely on photos, reviews, or business names, which don’t always capture the "vibe" of a place. Our solution addresses this gap by curating locations based on their mood or ambiance, providing a more intuitive way for users to choose their destination.

Whether users are in the mood for a cozy café, a lively bar, or a quiet park, our app will present tailored suggestions, allowing them to explore the city in a way that feels right in the moment. By matching places with moods, we hope to offer a more personalized and enjoyable experience, making it simple to find the perfect spot for every vibe.
